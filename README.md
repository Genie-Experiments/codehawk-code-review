# CodeHawk
CodeHawk is an automated code review system that integrates with GitLab and GitHub, utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze code changes in merge requests and provide feedback on quality, performance, security, and maintainability.

## Features
- **Automated Code Reviews**: Provides detailed feedback on code changes in merge requests.
- **Interactive Responses**: Responds dynamically to developer queries using LLMs.
- **Focus Areas**: Performance, security, efficiency, maintainability, and adherence to conventions.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Seamless integration with GitLab pipelines.

## Setup
1. **Copy CI/CD Configuration**:
    - Copy the .gitlab-ci.yml file from this repository to your GitLab project.
    - Create a merge request with the "review" label.

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
    - Obtain a GitLab trigger token:
        - Go to Settings > CI/CD > Pipeline Trigger Tokens.
        - Create a token and store it in your environment variables.
        - Add the GitLab token as an environment variable in your GitLab project.

3. **Configure Webhooks**:
    - Add a webhook in GitLab to trigger the review process:
        - Go to Settings > Webhooks.
        - Set the target URL to your deployed webhook endpoint.

## Usage
1. Initial Code Review Flow
    - Triggered when a new merge request is created or updated with the review label.
    - Analyzes code changes.
    - Posts review comments generated by the LLM.
2. Interactive Clarification Flow
    - Triggered when a developer replies to a comment mentioning @codehawk.
    - Retrieves the context of the query.
    - Responds with LLM-generated replies.
